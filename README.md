# Microwriter
Modern and functional emulation of the 1983 Microwriter text entry system, utilizing an ESP32-P4 microcontroller and a five-key keyboard matrix to input characters via "chords" (combinations of keypresses). The project allows writing text on an RGB 1602 LCD and sharing it via a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)
